                               using the registry's change history; (3)

                              Gold OA denotes a publication in an OA journal. 
                              Hybrid OA denotes an OA publication in a journal
                              which offers both a subscription based model as well
                              as an OA option. Green OA denotes a freely available
                              repository version. Bronze OA denotes publications
                              which are freely available on the journal page, but
                             without a clear open license. As publications can have several
                              OA versions, we defined a hierarchy for categories:
                              gold - hybrid - green - bronze - closed. The absolute
